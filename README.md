# Supply-Chain-Domain-LLM---Phi-3-Fine-tuned-Model
A specialized language model fine-tuned on supply chain graph data for generating Neo4j Cypher queries from natural language.   This model converts natural language questions about supply chain operations into executable Cypher queries for Neo4j graph databases. It's trained on 10,000+ examples based on the Kaggle Supply Chain dataset structure.
